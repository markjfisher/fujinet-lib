Feature: library test - apple2 network_close

  This tests fujinet-network apple2 network_close

  Scenario: execute apple2 _network_close with non-0 network id
    Given apple2-fn-nw application test setup
      And I add common apple2-sp files
      And I add apple2 src file "fn_network/network_close.s"
      And I add common src file "network_unit.s"
      And I add file for compiling "features/apple2/fn_network/invokers/test_network_close.s"
      And I create and load apple-single application using crt-file "features/apple2/fn_network/stubs/crt0.s"
      And I write string "n5:foo" as ascii to memory address $a012
      And I write word at t_devicespec with hex $a012
      And I write memory at _sp_network with $02
      And I ignore cc65-noise
     When I execute the procedure at _init for no more than 2000 instructions

    Then I expect register A equal 0
     And I expect register X equal 0
     And I expect to see t_cb_executed equal 1
     # CMD is SP_CMD_CONTROL (4)
     And I expect to see spe_cmd equal $4
     # DEST is smartport NETWORK device (2)
     And I expect to see spe_dest equal 2
     # 'C' control code
     And I expect to see _sp_cmdlist+4 equal 67

  Scenario: execute apple2 _network_close when network id is unset
    Given apple2-fn-nw application test setup
      And I add common apple2-sp files
      And I add apple2 src file "fn_network/network_close.s"
      And I add common src file "network_unit.s"
      And I add file for compiling "features/apple2/fn_network/invokers/test_network_close.s"
      And I create and load apple-single application using crt-file "features/apple2/fn_network/stubs/crt0.s"
      And I write string "n5:foo" as ascii to memory address $a012
      And I write word at t_devicespec with hex $a012
      # ensure _sp_network is reset to 0 so we can test what happens when it is
      And I write memory at t_sp_network with $00
      And I ignore cc65-noise
     When I execute the procedure at _init for no more than 1850 instructions

    Then I expect register A equal FN_ERR_BAD_CMD
     And I expect register X equal 0
     # sp_status was not called
     And I expect to see t_cb_executed equal 0
     And I expect to see _fn_device_error equal SP_ERR_BAD_UNIT
