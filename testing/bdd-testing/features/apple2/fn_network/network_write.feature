Feature: library test - apple2 network_write

  This tests fujinet-network apple2 network_write

  # -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Scenario: execute apple2 _network_write with no network unit returns bad cmd and does not call sp_write
    Given apple2-fn-nw application test setup
      And I add common apple2-sp files
      And I add apple2 src file "fn_network/network_write.s"
      And I add apple2 src file "bus/sp_write.s"
      And I add file for compiling "features/apple2/fn_network/invokers/test_network_write.s"
      And I create and load apple-single application using crt-file "features/apple2/fn_network/stubs/crt0.s"
      And I write memory at _sp_network with 0
      And I ignore cc65-noise
     When I execute the procedure at _init for no more than 250 instructions

    Then I expect register A equal FN_ERR_BAD_CMD
     And I expect register X equal 0
     And I expect to see _fn_device_error equal SP_ERR_BAD_UNIT
     And I expect to see t_cb_executed equal 0
