Feature: library test - apple2 network_json_query

  This tests fujinet-network apple2 network_json_query

  # -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Scenario: execute apple2 _network_json_query returns query results (happy path)
    Given apple2-fn-nw application test setup
      And I add common apple2-sp files
      And I add apple2 src file "fn_network/network_json_query.s"
      And I add apple2 src file "bus/sp_read.s"
      And I add file for compiling "features/apple2/fn_network/invokers/test_network_json_query.s"
      And I create and load apple-single application using crt-file "features/apple2/fn_network/stubs/crt0.s"
      And I write memory at _sp_network with 1
      And I write string "n1:foo" as ascii to memory address $9000
      And I write word at t_devicespec with hex $9000
      And I write string "/bar" as ascii to memory address $9100

      And I write string "XXXXXXXXXXXXX" as ascii to memory address $9200
      And I write word at t_s with hex $9200
      And I ignore cc65-noise
     When I execute the procedure at _init for no more than 3250 instructions

     # cmdlist[4] is codes value, for sp_read, it's the lo byte of length of the read instead of ctrlcode/statcode.
     # for the test, it's 10 by default
     And I expect to see t_cb_codes+2 equal 10
     And I expect to see t_r3_unit equal 1
     When I hex+ dump ascii between t_r1_payload+2 and t_r1_payload+6
     Then property "test.BDD6502.lastHexDump" must contain string "/bar"

     # copied the "read" string with nul to destination, not overwriting final X ($58)
     When I hex+ dump ascii between $9200 and $920C

     # sp_payload was zeroed out, so only bytes in there are the ones we have from the query, this is the state BEFORE doing read
     When I hex+ dump ascii between t_r2_payload and t_r2_payload+8
     Then property "test.BDD6502.lastHexDump" must contain string ": 05 00 2f 62 61 72 00 00 :"
     Then property "test.BDD6502.lastHexDump" must contain string "/bar"

     # final Payload after sp_read contains length, then string, then 0s
     When I hex+ dump ascii between _sp_payload and _sp_payload+16
     Then property "test.BDD6502.lastHexDump" must contain string ": 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38  39 30 00 00 00 00 00 00 :"
