Feature: IO library test - fn_fuji_mount_host_slot

  This tests FN-FUJI fn_fuji_mount_host_slot

  Scenario Outline: execute _fuji_mount_host_slot successfully
    Given atari-fn-fuji application test setup
      And I add common atari-io files
      And I add atari src file "fn_fuji/fuji_mount_host_slot.s"
      And I add file for compiling "features/atari/fn_fuji/test-apps/test_b.s"
      And I add file for compiling "features/atari/fn_fuji/stubs/bus-simple.s"
      And I create and load atari application
      And I write memory at $80 with $00
      And I write memory at t_b1 with <slot>
      And I write word at t_fn with address _fuji_mount_host_slot
     When I execute the procedure at _init for no more than 80 instructions

    # check the DCB values were set correctly
    Then I expect to see DDEVIC equal $70
     And I expect to see DUNIT equal $01
     And I expect to see DTIMLO equal $0f
     And I expect to see DCOMND equal $f9
     # rare to see 00 in DSTATS
     And I expect to see DSTATS equal $00
     And I expect to see DBYTLO equal $00
     And I expect to see DBYTHI equal $00
     And I expect to see DAUX1 equal <slot>
     And I expect to see DAUX2 equal $00
     And I expect to see DBUFLO equal $00
     And I expect to see DBUFHI equal $00

    # Check return value in A/X
     And I expect register A equal $00
     And I expect register X equal $00

    # verify BUS was called
     And I expect to see $80 equal 1

    Examples:
    | slot |
    | 0    |
    | 1    |
    | 2    |

  Scenario: execute _fuji_mount_host_slot with error
    Given atari-fn-fuji application test setup

      And I add file for compiling "features/atari/fn_fuji/stubs/bus-simple-err.s"
      And I create and load atari application
      And I write memory at $80 with $00
      And I write memory at t_bus_err with $69
      And I write memory at t_b1 with $01
      And I write word at t_fn with address _fuji_mount_host_slot
